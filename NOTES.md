[] On the inputs for calories, validate that the user is not deviating too much from our recommended caloric intake, we can allow them to do it
since they might have a cheat day but warn them about it.

[] Make calories and weights records that are older than 10 days read-only, this way we don't have to make the tdee estimation
super complex and have to recalculate things in the past.
